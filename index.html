Killua Zoldyck (キルア=ゾルディック, Kirua Zorudikku) is initially introduced as a cheeky, cheerful and mischievous kid who befriends Gon during the Hunter Exam. His ruthlessness and aptitude in killing show the other side of him — deadly, violent, and bloodthirsty. A member of the famous Zoldyck Family of assassins, Killua has been trained to be an assassin since birth and conditioned to possess extreme tolerance for poison, electricity and pain. Although Killua fails during his first Hunter Exam by killing an opponent, likely due to his elder brother Illumi's influence, he attends the exam again the following year, earning his license by eliminating all other applicants in the very first trial.[ch. 36, 37, 148] Killua and Gon learn about Nen from Wing and later train further under Biscuit Krueger.[ch. 47, 48, 137] He becomes one of the first people to beat Greed Island, helps stop the Chimera Ants, and uses his sibling Alluka's special abilities to heal the dying Gon. As Gon is about to meet Ging, Killua decides to part ways and travel the world with Alluka
